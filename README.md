One-time pad
---------------
This program is a work in progress. 

Implementation of the cryptographic OTP algorithm. This implementation will be made to be compatible with an alphanumeric character set. 
It will also be able to preserve punctuation and white space when converting between plaintext and ciphertext. 

Inspired by a [video](https://youtu.be/R5LqOqaBYG8) from the Modern Rogue YouTube channel.
